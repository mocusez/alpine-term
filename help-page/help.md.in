% Alpine Term

Alpine Term, aka Alpine Linux Terminal, is a virtual machine running the
[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) — a security-oriented, lightweight
Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

Application does not use KVM and should work on any rootless device running
Android 7.0 or higher. Here are the recommended minimal system properties:

 - 2 GHz CPU
 - 2 GB RAM
 - 6 GB disk space on internal storage

If your hardware properties do not meet these ones, you may observe issues
during installation or at runtime.

This application is general-purpose and you are limited only by environment
isolation and performance.

### User interface
#### Terminal

The application emulates a subset of the X Window System (xterm) terminal
with TrueColor support. Its capabilities should be enough for most of the
available command line programs.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="QEMU session screenshot" src="img/qemu_session.png" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

As a connection to the virtual machine is done over serial line, a proper
terminal window handshake is not possible. As a result, the virtual machine
is not aware of the current state of the terminal emulator. If there is a
window size mismatch between terminal emulator and virtual machine, you may
observe visual glitches such as displaced or disappeared text when using
certain programs.

Use utility 'resize' to make sure that the console size matches the size
of the screen. If the terminal was messed up, use the utility 'reset'
which will clean screen and reset the terminal to initial state.

The terminal is sensitive to taps and gestures. For example, pinch-zooming
will change the font size and short tap will act as a mouse click. Long
tap will toggle a text selection and the [context menu](#context-menu).
By swiping rightwards, a [navigation drawer](#navigation-drawer) will be
revealed.

#### Context menu

The context menu can be shown by long pressing anywhere on the
terminal. It provides menu entries for:

 - Opening VNC connection. Available only if [RealVNC Viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android)
   is installed.
 - Copying or pasting text from clipboard.
 - Showing this help page.
 - Opening URL selector dialog.
 - Sharing text from the terminal to other apps.
 - Resetting the terminal state if it got messed up.
 - Changing a color scheme of the terminal.
 - Check box to control whether bell characters should be ignored.

#### Navigation drawer

The navigation drawer is revealed by swiping inwards from the left
part of screen.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Navigation drawer screenshot" src="img/app_drawer.png" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

It contains few additional elements:

 1. The list of sessions: the first one is [QEMU monitor](#qemu-monitor)
    and the last four sessions are serial consoles (ttyS1-ttyS3). Click
    on a session to open.
 2. The button to toggle visibility of a touch keyboard.
    <br>Long press will toggle the [extra keys row](#extra-keys-row) (3).

#### Notification

While Alpine Term is running, it displays a notification which can be
expanded by a pinch-zooming or a single-finger glide gestures to expose
the action for toggling wake lock to prevent device's CPU going into
sleep mode.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Notification screenshot" src="img/app_notification.png" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

Clicking on the notification will open the current terminal session.

#### Extra keys row

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Extra keys row screenshot" src="img/extra_keys_row.png" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

Alpine Term provides a row, which contains some keys frequently used
to interact with the command line. It can be toggled by either a long
press on the keyboard button located on the [drawer](#navigation-drawer)
or by **Volume Up+Q** and **Volume Up+K** key combinations.

Swiping upwards certain keys will expose the alternate ones. Particularly:

 - `-` will show a key for `_`
 - `|` will show a key for `&`

Swiping the extra keys row leftwards will reveal the [text input field](#text-input-field).

#### Text input field

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
  <img alt="Text input field screenshot" src="img/alt_text_input.png" style="width:90%;max-width:700px;">
</span>

The terminal does not support the advanced features of the touch
keyboards like a predictive input or swipe typing. As a workaround,
the application provides a special text input field where all these
features work correctly.

***

### Keyboard

#### Touch keyboard shortcuts

**Volume Down** button emulates **Ctrl** key which can be combined with
others to request a special action from command line tools. Common key
combinations are:

 - **Ctrl+A** → Move cursor to the beginning of line
 - **Ctrl+C** → Interrupt the current process with SIGINT
 - **Ctrl+D** → Send end-of-file to the standard input
 - **Ctrl+E** → Move cursor to the end of line
 - **Ctrl+K** → Delete text from cursor to the end of line
 - **Ctrl+L** → Clear the terminal
 - **Ctrl+Z** → Suspend the current process with SIGTSTP

**Volume Up** key is used to produce certain input on the following
combinations:

 - **Volume Up+.** → Ctrl+\\ (SIGQUIT)
 - **Volume Up+1** → F1 (and **Volume Up+2** → F2, etc)
 - **Volume Up+0** → F10
 - **Volume Up+A** → Left arrow key
 - **Volume Up+B** → Alt+B, back a word (if using readline)
 - **Volume Up+D** → Right arrow key
 - **Volume Up+E** → Escape key
 - **Volume Up+F** → Alt+F, forward a word (if using readline)
 - **Volume Up+H** → ~ (the tilde character)
 - **Volume Up+K** → Alias for **Volume Up+Q**
 - **Volume Up+L** → | (the pipe character)
 - **Volume Up+N** → Page Down
 - **Volume Up+P** → Page Up
 - **Volume Up+Q** → Toggle extra keys row
 - **Volume Up+S** → Down arrow key
 - **Volume Up+T** → Tab key
 - **Volume Up+U** → _ (the underscore character)
 - **Volume Up+V** → Show the volume control
 - **Volume Up+W** → Up arrow key
 - **Volume Up+X** → Alt+X

Note that **Volume Up** does not represent an **Alt** key even though
it is able to emulate some its combinations.

#### Hardware keyboard shortcuts

These keys in combination with **Ctrl+Alt** will trigger certain
actions of Alpine Term when using a hardware keyboard:

 - **+/-** → Adjust text size
 - **1-5** → Go to the session with specified number
 - **M** → Show the [context menu](#context-menu)
 - **N** → Switch to the next session
 - **P** → Switch to the previous session
 - **U** → Open URL selector
 - **V** → Paste clipboard
 - **Left arrow** → Close drawer
 - **Right arrow** → Open drawer
 - **Down arrow** → Alias for **N**
 - **Up arrow** → Alias for **P**

##### List of device IDs

|Device                   | ID        |
|:------------------------|:----------|
|Primary CD-ROM block     |`cd0`      |
|Primary CD-ROM device    |`scsi-cd0` |
|Secondary CD-ROM block   |`cd1`      |
|Secondary CD-ROM device  |`scsi-cd1` |
|Primary HDD block        |`hd0`      |
|Primary HDD device       |`scsi-hd0` |
|Secondary HDD block      |`hd1`      |
|Secondary HDD device     |`scsi-hd1` |
|Network interface card   |`vmnic0`   |

##### Limiting RAM usage

You can limit RAM usage by configuring VirtIO Balloon device through QEMU
monitor. See an example below how to limit memory usage to 350 MiB:

```
balloon 350
```

If guest operating system uses less memory than specified value, QEMU will
de-allocate host RAM and update visible memory size for the virtual machine.
In other cases virtual machine may not release used memory or do that
partially.

Some kernels or custom operating systems may not support this feature.

##### Backing up the HDD image

Use QEMU monitor to back up the operating system image. You can do this by
executing the next command:

```
drive_backup -f -c hd0 /sdcard/backup.qcow2 qcow2
```

This command will copy the data into the new compressed (option '-c') QCOW2
image ready for reuse. You can continue to use the virtual machine during
the backup process. Progress can be tracked by this command:

```
info block-jobs
```

After finishing you can get your image in the Alpine Term private directory
on [shared storage](#sharing-files-between-host-and-vm).

##### Restoring the HDD image

The restoring operation is quite complicated as you cannot have direct
access to the runtime directory of Alpine Term. However, you can use trick
with the 'drive_backup' command to overwrite the original HDD image.

~~~~ {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
# First, reset and stop the virtual machine:
system_reset
stop

# Check the path where the original image is being stored:
info block

# Here it will be assumed that its path is
# /data/user/0/alpine.term/files/run/alpine-linux-hdd.qcow2

# Remove the primary HDD:
drive_del hd0
device_del scsi-hd0

# Now you can temporarily add your backup image as a block device:
drive_add 0 if=none,id=temphd0,format=qcow2,file=/sdcard/backup.qcow2

# And overwrite the original HDD image:
drive_backup -f -c temphd0 /data/user/0/alpine.term/files/run/alpine-linux-hdd.qcow2 qcow2
~~~~

Wait until job finishes (command 'info block-jobs') and then restart Alpine Term.

For more details about shell usage and scripting you can read the
[Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](doc/bash-advanced.html). Although
this guide is for Bash shell, most of the tips apply to other shells
as well.

Also read the [Alpine Linux Wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org) for details
about administering Alpine systems.

#### Using custom disk images

You can have additional CD-ROM or HDD image. To do so place your ISO or
QCOW2 file on [shared storage](#sharing-files-between-host-and-vm) into
this directory:

~~~~ {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
/storage/self/primary/Android/data/alpine.term/files
~~~~

Ensure that image file names are 'cdrom.iso' for CD-ROM and 'hdd.qcow2'
for HDD respectively. Note that this way allows you to have only one
image of each type.

*This method is deprecated on Android 11+ due to storage changes.*

Another variant how to add a disk image would be the use of the monitor
console. Here is an example of how to add a custom CD-ROM image:

~~~~ {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
# Regular way with just ISO file.
drive_add 0 if=none,media=cdrom,id=cd1,file=/sdcard/mycd.iso

# Or remote image accessible over HTTP:
drive_add 0 if=none,media=cdrom,id=cd1,file=https://example.com/cdrom.iso

# NBD also works:
drive_add 0 if=none,media=cdrom,id=cd1,file=nbd://192.168.1.10:1024/cdrom

# Once block device is added, create a CD-ROM device:
device_add scsi-cd,id=scsi-cd1,drive=cd1
~~~~

#### Sharing files between host and VM

The Alpine Term application maintains a directory on Android storage for
sharing files between host and virtual machine. Inside the virtual machine
this directory is mounted at '/mnt/shared' by `fstab` and on the host it
is usually accessible at

~~~~ {.numberLines startFrom="1"}
/storage/self/primary
~~~~

Sharing files may not be possible through this way if host shared storage
is not available. That are rare cases however, like when shared storage is
actually removable SD-CARD which was ejected.

**Warning**: if you want to uninstall the Alpine Term, do not forget
to move files from the host shared directory to a different place.
Otherwise, all its data will be lost.

#### Shutting down the VM

You can shut down the virtual machine and exit application with these
ways:

 - Executing command 'quit' in QEMU monitor for immediate exit. May
   leave HDD file system in an inconsistent state.
 - Executing command 'system_powerdown' in QEMU monitor to initiate
   OS shut down through ACPI.
 - Executing command 'poweroff' in OS shell.

If application got frozen and does not respond for some reason, you
will need to force stop it through Android OS settings.
